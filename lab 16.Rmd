```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load our data files
```{r}
library(DESeq2)
metaFile <- "GSE37704_metadata.csv"
countFile <- "GSE37704_featurecounts.csv"

# Import metadata and take a peak
colData = read.csv(metaFile, row.names=1)
head(colData)
```
```{r}
# Import countdata
countData = read.csv(countFile, row.names=1)
head(countData)
```
> Q. Complete the code below to remove the troublesome first column from countData

```{r}
# Note we need to remove the odd first $length col
countData2 <- countData[,-1]

head(countData2)
```
Q. Complete the code below to filter countData to exclude genes (i.e. rows) where we have 0 read count across all samples (i.e. columns).

Tip: What will rowSums() of countData return and how could you use it in this context?


```{r}
# Filter count data where you have 0 read count across all samples.
zero.vals <- which(countData2[,1] == 0, arr.ind = TRUE)
to.rm <- unique(zero.vals)
countData2 = countData2[-to.rm, ]
head(countData2)
```


# 2. DEseq analysis 

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
```

```{r}
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData2,
                             colData=colData,
                             design=~condition)
dds = DESeq(dds)
```
get our results
```{r}
res <- results(dds)
head(res)
```
```{r}
res = results(dds, contrast=c("condition", "hoxa1_kd", "control_sirna"))
```

Q. Call the summary() function on your results to get a sense of how many genes are up or down-regulated at the default 0.1 p-value cutoff.
```{r}
summary(res)
```


Volcono plot
# Add annotation 

```{r}
library(AnnotationDbi)
library("org.Hs.eg.db")
```

```{r}
plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj) )
```

```{r}
# Make a color vector for all genes
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res) )

# Color red the genes with absolute fold change above 2
mycols[ abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 ] <- "red"

# Color blue those with adjusted p-value less than 0.01
#  and absolute fold change more than 2
inds <- (res$padj < 0.01) & (abs(res$log2FoldChange) > 2 )
mycols[ inds ] <- "blue"

plot( res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col=mycols, xlab="Log2(FoldChange)", ylab="-Log(P-value)" )
```


icolumns
```{r}
columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```


Q. Use the mapIDs() function multiple times to add SYMBOL, ENTREZID and GENENAME annotation to our results by completing the code below.

```{r}
res$symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res), 
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="SYMBOL",
                    multiVals="first")

res$entrez = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="ENTREZID",
                    multiVals="first")

res$name =   mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res),
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    column="GENENAME",
                    multiVals="first")

head(res, 10)
```

Q. Finally for this section let's reorder these results by adjusted p-value and save them to a CSV file in your current project directory.

```{r}
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
write.csv(res,file="deseq_results.csv")
```

KEGG pathways
```{r}
# Run in your R console (i.e. not your Rmarkdown doc!)
#BiocManager::install( c("pathview", "gage", "gageData") )

# For old vesrsions of R only (R < 3.5.0)!
#source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
#biocLite( c("pathview", "gage", "gageData") )
```

```{r}
library(pathview)
library(gage)
library(gageData)

data(kegg.sets.hs)
data(sigmet.idx.hs)

# Focus on signaling and metabolic pathways only
kegg.sets.hs = kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]

# Examine the first 3 pathways
head(kegg.sets.hs, 3)
```

```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```
Now, let’s run the gage pathway analysis.
```{r}
# Get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```

Now lets look at the object returned from gage().
```{r}
attributes(keggres)
```
Lets look at the first few down (less) pathway results:
```{r}
# Look at the first few down (less) pathways
head(keggres$less)
```

Now, let's try out the pathview() function from the pathview package to make a pathway plot with our RNA-Seq expression results shown in color.
To begin with lets manually supply a pathway.id (namely the first part of the "hsa04110 Cell cycle") that we could see from the print out above.
```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110")
```

![](hsa04110.pathview.png)
```{r}
# A different PDF based output of the same data
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110", kegg.native=FALSE)
```
```{r}
## Focus on top 5 upregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```
Finally, lets pass these IDs in keggresids to the pathview() function to draw plots for all the top 5 pathways.
```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")
```
![](hsa04142.pathview.png)
![](hsa04640.pathview.png)
![](hsa00140.pathview.png)
![](hsa04662.pathview.png)
![](hsa04630.pathview.png)
Q. Can you do the same procedure as above to plot the pathview figures for the top 5 down-reguled pathways?
```{r}
## Focus on top 5 downregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$less)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")
```
![](hsa00010.pathview.png)
![](hsa03440.pathview.png)
![](hsa04114.pathview.png)
![](hsa03030.pathview.png)
![](hsa04110.pathview.png)

section 3
We can also do a similar procedure with gene ontology. Similar to above, go.sets.hs has all GO terms. go.subs.hs is a named list containing indexes for the BP, CC, and MF ontologies. Let’s focus on BP (a.k.a Biological Process) here.

```{r}
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)

# Focus on Biological Process subset of GO
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets, same.dir=TRUE)

lapply(gobpres, head)
```

Section 4
```{r}
sig_genes <- res[res$padj <= 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), "symbol"]
print(paste("Total number of significant genes:", length(sig_genes)))
```

```{r}
write.table(sig_genes, file="significant_genes.txt", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```

Q: What pathway has the most significant “Entities p-value”? Do the most significant pathways listed match your previous KEGG results? What factors could cause differences between the two methods?
The endosomal/vascular pathway has the most significant "entities p-value". The most significants pathways listed do not math the previous KEGG results. A factor that could cause the differences between the two method is that the KEGG uses the threshold p-value of 0.05 while this uses the most significant.
