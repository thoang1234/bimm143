##a quick look at the PDB

```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data_Export_Summary.csv.csv",row.name = 1)
head(db)
```
Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
method.sums <- colSums(db)
round((method.sums/method.sums["Total"])*100,2)
```


Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

O
```{r}
round((db$Total/method.sums["Total"])*100,2)

```

Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
1828 structures

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

This is because the vmd only show the oxygen atom in water.


>Q5: There is a conserved water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have (see note below)?

Yes, HOH at 127



#using Bio3d

Need to load library(Bio3d)

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
 HOH
 
> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
2



```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)
```

```{r}
aa123(pdbseq(pdb))
```

the ATOM record

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```
```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

## Section 4
```{r}

#install.packages("bio3d")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("ggrepel")
#install.packages("devtools")
#install.packages("BiocManager")

#BiocManager::install("msa")
#devtools::install_bitbucket("Grantlab/bio3d-view")
```

>Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 
msa

>Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 
Grantlab/bio3d-view

>Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? True



>Search and retrieve ADK structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
```

```{r}
aa
```
>Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 
214


Now we can use this sequence as a query to BLAST search the PDB to find similar sequences and structures.

```{r}
#Blast or hmmer search 
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

function plot.blast() facilitates the visualization and filtering of the Blast results.
```{r}
# Plot a summary of search results
hits <- plot(b)
```

Here we proceed with only the top scoring hits (black).
```{r}
# List out some 'top hits'
head(hits$pdb.id)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','4X8M_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','4X8H_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','4NP6_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```


We can now use function get.pdb() and pdbslit() to fetch and parse the identified structures.
```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```
Align and superpose structures
Next we will use the pdbaln() function to align and also optionally fit (i.e. superpose) the identified PDB structures.

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE)#, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
```

Principal component analysis
```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```



Normal mode analysis

```{r}
# NMA of all structures
modes <- nma(pdbs)
```

```{r}
plot(modes, pdbs, col=grps.rd)
```

>Q14. What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?
The colored lines are more similar to each other than the black line. They differs the most at wround 50 and 150 residues, this difference is most likely because it is not an active binding site since binding sites in general are conservative.
