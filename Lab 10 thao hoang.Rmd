Reading Candy data 
```{r}
candy_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```
>Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
dim(candy)
```
>Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Almond Joy", ]$winpercent
```

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

>Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll", ]$winpercent
```

Skim Function 
```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Nougat and crispedricewafer has lower means, sd compared to the others. 

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

Zero and one represents whether the candy is chocolate or not.


>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

The distribution of winpercent values is not symmetrical

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center of the distribution is below 50%

>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
#average ranking of chocolate candy
avg_win_choco <- mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
avg_win_choco
#average ranking of fruity candy 
avg_win_fruit <- mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
avg_win_fruit
```
On average, chocolate candy rank higher than fruity candy 

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
x=candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]
y=candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]
t.test(x,y)
```
Yes, it is statistically different since the P value is extremely small. 


>Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```


>Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(-candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

>Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity')
```

>Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity')
```

Adding useful colors

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Worst ranking chocolate candy is sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Best ranking fruity candy is starbursts 


`Taking a look at pricepercent`

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

>Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

ReeseÃ•s Miniatures

```{r}
order <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing=TRUE)
head(candy[order,c(11,12)],n=5)
```


>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

least popular= Nik L Nip, also the most expensive
```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

`Exploring the correlation structure`
using corrplot
```{r}
library(corrplot)
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Two variables that are anti-correlated are fruity and chocolate

>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Two variables that are most positively correlated are chocolate and bar.


`Principal Component Analysis` 
applying PCA using prcom() function

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=FALSE)
summary(pca)
```

Plotting our main PCA score plot of PC1 vs PC2
```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```

We can change the plotting character and add some color:
```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

Using the ggrepel package and the function ggrepel::geom_text_repel() to label
```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

Using Plotly
```{r}
library(plotly)
```
```{r}
ggplotly(p)
```

Let’s finish by taking a quick look at PCA our loadings
```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```
>Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, hard, and pluribus. These make sense since a lot of fruity candies comes in a bag of asorted flavors and often times are hard candies.
